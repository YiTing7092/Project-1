    <h4>About</h4>
      <p>Hello, my name is Yi-Ting Lin. I come from Taiwan, a small island in Asia.
          I've been in US since 2015 summer, the reason I came to US is that I'd like to
          explore my life and experience the differnt culture and new things. I hope I can
          find a job about website management or database management, so I still cannot
          decide my specialization. </p>
    <h4>Personality</h4>
      <p>I am kind of shy, but when you get to know me then maybe you'll have different opinions about me.
         I'm not a talkative person, but I have the patience to listen. welcome to talk with me if you need someone to listen to you.
      </p>
    <h4>Interests</h4>
      <p>I like to watch Japanese animations and live game on Youtube.
